description=The ontology aims at modelling the data on cultural institutes or sites such as data regarding the agents that play a specific role on cultural institutes or sites, the sites themselves, the contact points, all multimedia files which describe the cultural institute or site and any other information useful to the public in order to access the institute or site. Moreover, the ontology represents events that can take place in specific cultural institutes or sites. The following figure illustrates some of the core elements of the ontology. The figure is not exaustive; however, it is included in order to help readers to understand some relationships among important concepts represented in the ontology. For each class, examples of their usage in turtle are provided; moreover, for only some of the classes, specific figures are reported that show the relationships and concepts connected to them. The alignment_xml.owl complements the ontology with the alignments with external ontologies such as FOAF, PRO, schma.org, dublin core, etc.
